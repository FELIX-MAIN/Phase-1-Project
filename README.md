## Fuel Delivery system
Due to limitation in infrastructure and economy in some of the areas in Kenya, most travelers have found themselves running out of fuel while travelling in most of the remote areas. In most cases it has been said that some of the travelers are attacked and hijacked in search of fuel thus making it insecure in some of the areas.
Such scenarios can be solved by insisting on travelers to rely on the system which does not require one to get out of his/her car or stray far away from it. They can also get fuel to anywhere they want as long as they have access to the system.

### Description
The aim is to choose from different stations the type of gas needed.
To also calculate the price depending on the quantity required.
To also be able to add stations from the client side.
